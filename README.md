# Geometry Visualizations

Visualizations of several computational geometry algorithms, written in Unity.

## Algorithms

* [x] Graham Scan/Monotone Chain
* [x] Jarvis March/Gift Wrapping
* [ ] Fortune's Algorithm
* [ ] Delaunay Triangulation (Randomized Incremental Construction)
* [x] Trapezoidal Map (Randomized Incremental Construction)

## Build Instructions

1. Install Unity 2018.2.15f
2. Download the project
3. Open each scene in `Assets/Scenes` to see each implementation
